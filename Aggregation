Task 4: Aggregate Functions and Grouping
1. COUNT() → Total number of bookings
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalBookings
FROM Booking;

2. SUM() → Total revenue collected
SELECT SUM(Amount) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Payment;

3. AVG() → Average payment amount
SELECT AVG(Amount) AS AveragePayment
FROM Payment;

4. GROUP BY → Total revenue per payment mode
SELECT PaymentMode, SUM(Amount) AS TotalAmount
FROM Payment
GROUP BY PaymentMode;

5. GROUP BY with COUNT → Number of bookings per vehicle
SELECT VehicleID, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfBookings
FROM Booking
GROUP BY VehicleID;

6. GROUP BY with multiple columns → Revenue per vehicle
SELECT V.OwnerName, V.VehicleNumber, SUM(P.Amount) AS TotalPaid
FROM Vehicle V
INNER JOIN Booking B ON V.VehicleID = B.VehicleID
INNER JOIN Payment P ON B.BookingID = P.BookingID
GROUP BY V.OwnerName, V.VehicleNumber;
